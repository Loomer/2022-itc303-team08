TDC DOCUMENTATION

---------------CNN Model---------------

• The file named “Loading_Data.ipynb” contains CNN model development
• This includes:
	o Importing Data
	o Cleaning and normalising data
	o Assembling Data into Training/Test Sets
	o Assembling convolutional layers
	o Training the model
	o Exporting model and testing external data with it
• ProgX acknowledges that while the model cannot yet accurately assessment or differentiate the steps involved in CNN model development are still present



-----------------GUI-----------------

• The GUI.py file contains a basic GUI that gives an overview of how the LungX application will run on a desktop
• It makes use of the built in Tkinter library to assemble the UI
• The program will open a Window prompting the user to upload a file by clicking a button labelled upload.
• The button will open a file explorer window for the user to select an image file
• After the upload the window will display a new button “Analyse”
• When the user clicks the analyse button the window will display the results frame with a mock-up of results.
